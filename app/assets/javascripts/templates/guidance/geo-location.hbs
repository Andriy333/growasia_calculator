  In this tool, geography plays - primarily through its influence on soil carbon content -
  a role in greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural activities.
  Soils in different areas of the region have different soil organic carbon contents.

  Furthermore, the relative impact that different soil
  management activities (such as tillage) have on the soil carbon content varies
  by an areaâ€™s particular climate (temperature and precipitation level).

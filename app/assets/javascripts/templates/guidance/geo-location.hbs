  In this tool, geography plays - primarily through its influence on soil carbon content -
  a role in greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural activities primarily
  through its influence on soil carbon content. Soils in different areas of the
  region have different soil organic carbon contents.

<p class="text -plain-text">
  Furthermore, the relative impact that different soil
  management activities (such as tillage) have on the soil carbon content varies
  by an areaâ€™s particular climate (temperature and precipitation level).

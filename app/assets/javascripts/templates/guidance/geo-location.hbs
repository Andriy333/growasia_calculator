  In this tool, geography plays a role in greenhouse gas emissions from
  agricultural activities primarily through its influence on soil carbon content.
  Soils in different areas of the region have different soil organic carbon contents.

<p class="text -plain-text">
  Furthermore, the relative impact that different soil
  management activities (such as tillage) have on the soil carbon content varies
  by an areaâ€™s particular climate (temperature and precipitation level).

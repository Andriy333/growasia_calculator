<h3 class="text -help-title">Fertilizers</h3>

<p class="text -plain-text">
  On this page we ask you what types of fertilizer you use. You can select
  multiple organic and synthetic fertilizers.
  After selecting each one, you will then be asked how much of that
  fertilizer you use.
</p>

<p class="text -plain-text">
  Synthetic nitrogen fertilizer options include the following: urea, ammonia, ammonium
  sulphate, mono-ammonium phosphate (MAP), di-ammonium phosphate (DAP),
  ammonium nitrate, and calcium ammonium nitrate.
</p>

<p class="text -plain-text">
  Animal manure fertilizer includes the following categories: poultry litter,
  liquid; poultry litter, dry; other manure, liquid; and other manure, dry.
  Other manure includes manure from other animals, including cattle, sheep,
  horse, swine, and goat.

  Fertilizer use can lead to emissions of the greenhouse gases - nitrous oxide
  (N<sub>2</sub>O) and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>). When nitrogen-based fertilizers are applied to
  soils, it enhances the naturally occurring nitrification and denitrification
  chemical processes, which produce N<sub>2</sub>O as a by-product. Furthermore, emissions
  occur through the volatilization (in other words, conversion to a gas) of
  nitrogen, in the form of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Finally, the
  production of different synthetic fertilizers leads to emissions as well.

<p class="text -plain-text">
  The use of fertilizers also impacts soil carbon content and, therefore,
  emissions from soil when management practices change. Applying synthetic and
  animal manure fertilizers lead to greater carbon, in the form of biomass in crops. A
  portion of this biomass will most likely be returned to the soil after harvest,
  thereby enhancing soil carbon content. In addition, application of manure
  directly adds carbon to the soils.

<p class="text -plain-text">
  When the fertilizer applied is urea, additional emissions are released through
  hydrolysis. Hydrolysis is defined as the chemical reaction which breaks down a
  compound, in this case urea, in the presence of water. One of the products of
  the urea hydrolysis is bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3-</sub>), which in turn becomes CO<sub>2</sub>.

The type of crop is an essential input which will influence the rest of the
agricultural management questions in this tool. For instance, the practices for
growing paddy rice will be very different from those for growing corn.
These different practices, in turn, have different greenhouse gas emission impacts.

<p class="text -plain-text">
The area of land cultivated influences the total volume of greenhouse gas emissions.
As an example 100 hectares of potatoes cultivated will likely have substantially
smaller emissions than 1000 hectares of potatoes cultivated assuming all the same
management practices are applied.

Finally, the expected yield will be used to inform the emissions per unit of yield results.
